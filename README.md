# Foreground-Remover-Msc-Project
A Computer Vision Project that manipulates depth to remove foreground from images. This is visualized as a 3D point cloud.

Project Description: Depth Manipulation and Foreground Removal in Images using Computer Vision Techniques

Overview:
This project represents an advanced exploration of computer vision techniques, focusing on the manipulation of depth information to achieve foreground removal in images. Leveraging the COLMAP feature extraction method, 3D reconstruction is performed using a set of five or more images depicting a scene. The core objective is to modify the Z-axis information, eliminating unnecessary foreground depth. To enhance user interaction, a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) is developed using Tkinter. The project's scope extends further to incorporate deep learning models for monocular image analysis, testing the feasibility of 3D reconstruction from a single image using the COLMAP technique. This multifaceted project, undertaken as a Master's dissertation, underscores my proficiency in computer vision, GUI design, and deep learning model integration.

Project Goals:
The primary goals of this project were to:

1. Utilize COLMAP feature extraction for 3D reconstruction using five or more images.
2. Implement depth manipulation to remove foreground elements by modifying the Z-axis.
3. Develop a user-friendly GUI using Tkinter for intuitive interaction with the depth manipulation process.
4. Integrate deep learning models to investigate monocular image-based 3D reconstruction using the COLMAP technique.
5. Compare the performance of structure-from-motion and deep learning methods to determine optimal reconstruction results.

- Python
- COLMAP
- Tkinter (GUI development)
- Deep Learning Frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)

Key Features:
1. COLMAP-Based 3D Reconstruction:
Employed COLMAP feature extraction for 3D scene reconstruction from a set of images. Utilized five or more images to generate a 3D representation of the scene.

2. Depth Manipulation and Foreground Removal:
Introduced depth manipulation techniques to remove unnecessary foreground elements. Adjusted the Z-axis values to eliminate unwanted depth information from the scene.

3. Tkinter GUI Development:
Designed and developed a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. The GUI facilitated user interaction with depth manipulation, enhancing usability and accessibility.

4. Integration of Deep Learning Models:
Integrated deep learning models into the project to explore monocular image-based 3D reconstruction. Investigated the feasibility of generating 3D reconstructions from a single image using the COLMAP technique.

5. Performance Comparison:

Project Workflow: 
1. Extracted features from the input images using the COLMAP method to reconstruct the 3D scene.
2. Implemented depth manipulation techniques to eliminate unnecessary foreground depth information.
3. Developed a user-friendly GUI using Tkinter to interactively manipulate depth and visualize the reconstructed scene.
4. Incorporated deep learning models to assess the viability of monocular image-based 3D reconstruction.
5. Evaluated the performance of both structure-from-motion and deep learning methods to determine the most effective approach.
